# Binge Watch PRO
Simple and ugly-written extension for Google Chrome adding a progress bar with elapsed time in the top right corner, the ability to skip intros, recaps, and jump to another episode without any delay for a better binge experience. No more reaching for a mouse. 

Wrap yourself into a blanket, grab a hot tea, and watch those episodes. 

Watch them hard.
